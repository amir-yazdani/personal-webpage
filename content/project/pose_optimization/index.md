Although  teleoperation  is  a  promising  alternative to avoid injuries in high-risk tasks, awkward postures are still a primary contributor to works-related musculoskeletal disorders in teleoperation.   An   ergonomically   intelligent   teleoperation system  could  reduce  risk  by  providing  feedback  for  postural correction.  In  this  project,  we  introduce  a  novel  framework for  postural  optimization  in  teleoperation  that  benefits  from common  risk  assessment  tools  in  ergonomics  and  provides online postural correction as well as optimal initial posture correction for a teleoperator according to the type of teleoperation task. We evaluate our framework in a simulated teleoperation environment  including  the  robots  and  the  human.
