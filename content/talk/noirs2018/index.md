# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Advancements in automation and robotics have created a working environment where humans and robots labor alongside each other and together on collaborative tasks. Previously, there were few human interactions with robots during routine work, and most accidents with robots occurred during maintenance, setup and programming. Recently, humans and robots do more collaborative tasks, potentially increasing the risk of injury. This paper reviews and summarizes research topics mainly in robotics, but emphasizes potential research opportunities to accomplish safety and protect workers through collaborations with ergonomists and safety professionals. To protect human workers in this rapidly changing industrial paradigm shift, roboticists, ergonomists and safety professionals need to work together. Combining expertise to address human safety and optimize task planning for human-robot work will help change the perception of the safety of human-robot interactions in industry. These efforts are needed to accelerate the adoption of this emerging technology in our workplaces."
