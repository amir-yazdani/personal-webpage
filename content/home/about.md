# Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Utah Robotics Center](http://robotics.coe.utah.edu/), University of Utah. I do my research under supervisory of [Prof. Tucker Hermans](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/) and [Prof. Andrew Merryweather](https://mech.utah.edu/faculty/andrew-merryweather/) and I am affiliated with [Utah Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/) and [Laboratory of Ergonomics and Safety](https://ergo.mech.utah.edu/). I am passionate about human-aware prediction and planning for robots, reinforcement learning, artificial intelligence, and probabilistic robotics. My current research includes pose estimation and prediction, learning and planning under uncertainty, motion planning and ergonomics and safety in robotics. I also have experiences in the design and development of robots including serial, parallel and mobile robots.
