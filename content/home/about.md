# Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Utah Robotics Center](http://robotics.coe.utah.edu/), University of Utah. I do my research under supervisory of [Prof. Tucker Hermans](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/) and [Prof. Andrew Merryweather](https://mech.utah.edu/faculty/andrew-merryweather/) and I am affiliated with [Utah Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy (LL4MA Lab)](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/) and Laboratory of Ergonomics and Safety.

My current research includes *"probabilistic perception and planning"* in HRI and covers human state estimation, intelligent postural optimization, and risk-aware motion & manipulation planning.
I am passionate about using probabilistic modeling and HRI concepts in interactie behaviour prediction and planning for autonomos vehicles and intelligent robots.

Recently, I was selected as one of the [HRI Pioneers 2021](http://www.hripioneers.info/hri21/index.html) cohorts, a highly competitive doctoral workshop at the top venue for HRI research, and I am the co-chair of HRI Pioneers 2022.

I expect to graduate April 2022. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss future job opportunities.
