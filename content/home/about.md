# Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Utah Robotics Center](http://robotics.coe.utah.edu/), University of Utah. I do my research under supervisory of [Prof. Tucker Hermans](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/) and [Prof. Andrew Merryweather](https://mech.utah.edu/faculty/andrew-merryweather/) and I am affiliated with [Utah Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy (LL4MA Lab)](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/) and Laboratory of Ergonomics and Safety.

I am passionate about improving human-robot interaction (HRI) through developing new algorithms for robot perception and planning. My current research includes probabilistic perception and planning in HRI and covers human state estimation, ergonomics & safety optimization, teleoperation, risk-aware motion & manipulation planning, and inverse reinforcement learning.

I spent the 2019 summer at [Omron-Adept Research Center of America (ORCA)](https://www.adept.com/) in San Ramon, CA as a Robotics Research Intern working on online motion planning for industrial robots.

I also have experiences in the design and development of robots including serial, parallel and mobile robots.
