# Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Utah Robotics Center](http://robotics.coe.utah.edu/), University of Utah. I do my research under supervisory of [Prof. Tucker Hermans](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/) and [Prof. Andrew Merryweather](https://mech.utah.edu/faculty/andrew-merryweather/) and I am affiliated with [Utah Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy (LL4MA Lab)](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/) and Laboratory of Ergonomics and Safety.

I am passionate about improving human-robot interaction (HRI) through developing new algorithms for robot perception and planning. My current research includes probabilistic perception and planning in HRI and covers human state estimation, ergonomics & safety optimization, teleoperation, risk-aware motion & manipulation planning, and inverse reinforcement learning. I also have experiences in the design and development of robots including serial, parallel and mobile robots.

Recently, I was selected as one of the [HRI Pioneers 2021](http://www.hripioneers.info/hri21/index.html) [cohort](http://www.hripioneers.info/hri21/participants.html), a highly competitive doctoral workshop at the top venue for HRI research, and I will serve as the US General Chair of HRI Pioneers 2022.

I spent summer 2019 at [Omron-Adept Research Center of America (ORCA)](https://automation.omron.com/en/us/products/category/robotics) in San Ramon, CA as a Robotics Research Intern working on reactive motion planning for industrial robots.

I expect to graduate Fall 2021. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss future job opportunities.
