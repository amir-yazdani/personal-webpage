abstract = "Simulation of the four degree of freedom parallel robot (Quattrotaar) is subjective of this paper. The mathematical model of the parallel robot is obtained too. The workspace is optimized for Non-singular kinematic type-2. Artificial Bees Colony algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm as overall exploring algorithms are implemented and the results are compared to each other. In spite of any intrinsic complexity of the optimization problems, the result shows the capability of both methods for this robot parameters design. Comparison of the results indicates the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm runs faster than Artificial Bees Colony algorithm. The exploring volume consists of a plan with 500 mm x 500 mm dimension which move in a vertical direction from 500 mm to 1000 mm. One of the important hints of the paper is a 90-degree rotation of end effector around vertical axis Z. This rotation is caused more flexibility and dexterity for the robot. A 3-D model of Quattrotaar parallel robot is created by Computer Aided Design software and finally Quattrotaar is fabricated in Human and Robot Interaction Laboratory (Taarlab)."
