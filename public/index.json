Autonomous mobile manipulation presents a hurdle prior to safely being able to utilize robots in real life applications such as healthcare and warehouse robots.

We focus on the specific problem of manipulating legged objects such as those commonly found in healthcare environments and personal dwellings (e.g. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). We describe a probabilistic method for autonomous learning of an approximate dynamics model for these objects.

In addition, we account for multiple manipulation strategies by formulating the manipulation planning as a mixed-integer convex optimization problem. The proposed manipulation framework considers the hybrid control system comprised of i) choosing which leg to grasp, and ii) continuous applied forces to move the object. We propose a manipulation planning algorithm based on model predictive control to compensate for modeling errors and find an optimal path to manipulate the object from one configuration to another. We show results for several objects with different wheel configurations.

Since application of physical human-robot interaction (HRI) such as telesurgery and telemanipulation is becoming more prevalent we must consider the important problem of ensuring comfort and ergonomics of the operator in order to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, improve efficiency, and reduce error over long periods of work. Motivated by this problem, we envision an autonomous solution to improve ergonomics and worker safety in telemanipulation that includes three main steps: (1) estimating the human operator’s posture, (2) analysing the ergonomics and injury risk of the estimated posture, and (3) providing feedback from the robot to the human user to encourage moving toward a better posture. Current methods for human posture estimation in the literature, including marker-based and markerless posture estimations, are limited in many ways. Both of these approaches rely on vision systems which might be infeasible to set up in real workplaces. In this presentation, we focus on the first two problems and suggest a new approach to estimate posture of the human upper body in using only data observed from the robot and analyze the ergonomics of the posture. The main feature of telemanipulation that distinguishes it from other applications of posture estimation is the physical attachment of the human body to the master robot in one or more points. We believe that we can use this feature to estimate human posture without using any additional sensors other than the robot. We model the human upper body using a redundant, partially observable dynamic system. This allows us to naturally formulate the estimation problem as probabilistic inference and solve the inference problem using a standard particle filter. We formalize this as a probabilistic inference problem where, we measure the robot’s stylus trajectory (including pose and velocity) as the observation and infer the unobserved human posture (joint angles and angular velocities). We encode human factors and biomechanics knowledge into our partially observable dynamics model. We use anthropometry models to estimate the segment lengths of the human body and impose limits on joint angles. We incorporate multiple observations over time enabling us to perform inference using a standard particle filter. We evaluate our approach using simulation and human-subject experiments and compare it with the human posture estimations from a commercial motion capture system and an off-the-shelf depth-based markerless posture-estimation algorithm. We use RULA assessment tool to analyze the ergonomics of the task based on the estimated posture. In simulation, as expected, the model with full measurement has the lowest RMS error across all the experiment tasks. As the complexity of task increases, the effect of measurements becomes more pronounced. However, the highest RMS error achieved using the “no-measurement model” remains less than 10 deg. We see that the estimated joint angles track the ground truth posture relatively close. However, due to redundancy of the human model, we can see noticeable errors in some joints, even though the hand estimate tracks the stylus well. In human subject test, it is obvious that markerless posture estimation using Kinect V2 has a poor performance in comparison with motion capture and particle filter algorithm. Although the markerless algorithm could successfully track a human standing in open areas, it was unable to track the human well while sitting behind the desk and working with the robot. The results from the motion capture system were also sometimes wrong or jumpy in some tasks, especially for the wrist joint. Overall, the posture estimated from our approach and from motion capture system generally agree with an average deviation of around (17 deg).  The RULA score we provide also agrees with the score given by ergonomists. In this presentation, we addressed a new problem in physical HRI: human posture estimation from the robot without any additional sensors and automatic ergonomic analysis of the estimated posture. We define the problem as a partially observable dynamical system and use a particle filter to estimate posture of a 10-DOF model of the human upper body. The proposed approach can fit different populations of users with different body segment lengths and can be easily implemented in different applications.","tags":[],"title":"Human Posture Estimation and Ergonomics Analysis Solely from the Robot in Physical Human-Robot Interaction","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project we introduce a patient assistant mobile (PAM) robot to monitor patient behavior and provide a cost-effective physical presence to continuously observe a patient and the environment to prevent falls.\nMany common objects found inside hospital rooms and personal dwellings have legs (e.g. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands).

As a result, there is a great need for developing improved control algorithms and better guidelines to allow humans and robots to safely work together in a synergistic fashion. The nature of human variability requires the robot to be able to learn and adapt to these changes while maintaining safety in the presence of an often unpredictable human worker. This paper proposes a novel solution to create safe and fault-tolerant motion planning and control of industrial robots for safe human-robot cooperation. First, human motion in a collaborative task with a robot was recorded with a ten-camera motion capture system. Then, a novel algorithm developed on for fault-tolerant motion planning and control of industrial robots to increase the human safety in human and robot collaboration. It has been done by characterizing human motion patterns in real-time while preventing collision between human and robot and minimizing harmful sudden motions when a failure occurs in robot actuators. The proposed algorithm benefits from using convex optimization, disjunctive programming and receding horizon concept to work in real-time. Simulation studies has been developed in ROS and Gazebo softwares and results reveals the performance of the algorithm to solve the simultaneous fault-tolerant and collision-free motion planning problem in industrial robots. Using the proposed algorithm will minimize velocity jumps of robot due to sudden actuator failures and avoid collision with human worker while maintaining acceptable levels of productivity.

Previously, there were few human interactions with robots during routine work, and most accidents with robots occurred during maintenance, setup and programming. Recently, humans and robots do more collaborative tasks, potentially increasing the risk of injury. This paper reviews and summarizes research topics mainly in robotics, but emphasizes potential research opportunities to accomplish safety and protect workers through collaborations with ergonomists and safety professionals. To protect human workers in this rapidly changing industrial paradigm shift, roboticists, ergonomists and safety professionals need to work together. Combining expertise to address human safety and optimize task planning for human-robot work will help change the perception of the safety of human-robot interactions in industry.

This problem has been fully analyzed for two three-DOF parallel robots, ie 3s-RPR parallel mechanism and the so-called Tripteron, while the shortest path is selected as the objective function. It should be noted that the first case study is a parallel mechanism with complex singularity loci expression from a convex optimization problem standpoint, while the second case is a parallel manipulator for which each limb has two links, an issue which increases the complexity of the optimization problem. Since some of the constraints are non-convex, two approaches are introduced in order to convexify them: (1) A McCormick-based relaxation merged with a branch-and-prune algorithm to prevent it from becoming too loose and (2) a first-order approximation which linearizes the non-convex quadratic constraints.

Each year, about 35% of individuals over age 65 experience one or more falls. Falls are the third leading cause of chronic disability worldwide6. In this project, we tried to address the concerns with home falls with a low-cost, intelligent mobile robot that will provide mobility aids, such as a walker, in the event that it determines that risk of fall is high.\nAs the project for Motion Planning course, a simplified version of the aforementioned bigger problem was defined in a simulation-based approach. In the proposed project, the problem includes the manipulation of a walker around an obstacle-filled area using a mobile robot from a start position to a goal position. For simulation studies, all objects will be projected to the 2D plane. The mobile robot is shows as a circle, the walker is shown as a box, and obstacles as shown as simple blue polygons. Several assumptions for the problem have been made:\n Only pushing has been used for manipulating the box. Start and goal position of the box and start position of the robot are known. Obstacles and their position are known.  The proposed approach to solve the above problem includes a high-level planner for push planning for the box and a lower level planner for motion planning of the robot. Based on what has been learned up to the point of proposal, a modified A* planning algorithm as a high-level planner in combination with RRT algorithm were proposed as the solution.

The kinematic analysis of the robot, design of the components, and manufacturing of the robot are explained as well. The proposed system is employed to generate a Virtual Sense (VirSense) with fixed-base motors and a spring compensation system for counterbalancing the torques generated by the weight of the links. The fixed bases of the motors reduce the system's effective mass and inertia, which is an important factor in haptic interface systems. A novel cabling system is used to transmit the motor torques to the end-effector. The spring-based gravity compensation system causes more reduction in the effective mass and inertia.

I designed a novel 4-DOF serial-parallel robot to be the base platform of driving simulators. It is a hybrid mechanism benefiting from the advantages of both serial and parallel mechanisms. The main challenge in this project was to design a mechanism structure based on the required motion for the driving simulators to provide the user with the most realistic feeling of driving. The final design is a 2-PSS+1U mechanism and the robot provides surge, pitch, roll, and heave motions. The fixed base is connected to the moving platform by two limbs with PSS as the kinematic arrangement. A fixed passive leg is connected by a U joint to the moving platform which removes four DOFs from the moving platform, resulting in a two DOF parallel mechanism. Except for the fixed limb, each leg is connected to the base and moving platform with spherical joints. The passive limb is connected to the moving platform with a universal joint.\nInverse kinematics of the mechanism is also solved to find four different working modes of the mechanism to map the required motion of moving platform into actuators. Forward kinematics of the system is also solved using elimination and resultant techniques. The design of the mechanism also includes determining singularities of the robot and its singularity-free workspace and it is done by a CAD software and interval analysis approach. Interval Analysis method has the advantages of being able to deal with almost any constraint and any number of DOF and is proved to be efficient in computing the most difficult case of 6-dimensional workspaces. To find the Jacobian matrix of the mechanism, first, the kinematical screw system (KSS) of all the limbs constituting the mechanism is obtained. Then, the constraint imposed on the moving platform by the limbs are found which can be done by applying the concept of the reciprocal screw system to the KSS of all the limbs. Finally, each row of the Jacobian matrix is computed by resorting again to the concept of the reciprocal screw and obtain the corresponding KSS by locking the actuators.

VirSense has a serial linkage mechanism and it is the 1st serial haptic device that uses a passive system for gravitational compensation. The passive system includes linear springs to compensate the forces and torques generated by the weight of the moving part of the robot without increasing the effective mass and inertia of the robot. Using the inverse dynamics, the effect of gravity on each joint has been determined and based on those values the stiffness coefficients of the designed springs are determined.\n CAD model of VirSense haptic device.   This novel spring system allows VirSense to compensate 95% of the gravity torque passively by the springs and 5% actively by the motors. This gravity compensation is effective in the entire workspace of VirSense. In serial robots, actuators are normally placed at each active joint and move with the previous link. Therefore, fixing actuators to the base is a challenging issue. The novel cabling mechanism in VirSense allowed us to install all motors (one for the yaw axis and two for the pitch axes) on a fixed base so that the moving mass/inertia and as a result the effective mass/inertia of the robot are reduced. This approach makes using larger and more powerful motors possible which leads to higher haptic force capacity in interaction with the user.\n Wire routes for 1st pitch (left) and 2nd pitch (right) in VirSense.   In addition, kinematics, Jacobian matrix, singular points, and the workspace of VirSense are determined. A customized pulley mechanism has been designed and placed in the bottom section of the robot as a guide for power transmission cables from the motors to the links. This structure prevents the cables from rupture, entanglement, or length variation. To have permanent tension in the cables, the cable from each motor acts for both extension and flexion. Cabling system has been designed such that the cables connected to the pitch disks will not change length with the change of the yaw angle. No interference with other cables will occur either.\nThe novel features of VirSense robot in comparison with Phantom PP1.5HF are: eliminating body motions for all three motors; allowing more powerful motors; producing larger instantaneous and continuous forces; eliminating limitations in the physical size and weight of motors; compensating 95% of gravitational torques by springs in the entire workspace of the robot; and having twice workspace as PP1.5HF robot’s workspace.\n","date":1272351600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1272351600,"objectID":"d46996784d40ef69976b9848af9f99ba","permalink":"https://amir-yazdani.github.io/project/virsense/","publishdate":"2010-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/virsense/","section":"project","summary":"Design and developing VirSense, a novel haptic device with automatic gravity compensation and fixed-base actuators","tags":["Haptics"],"title":"VirSense Haptic Device","type":"project"}]
