We address this problem by introducing PAM, a patient assistant mobile robot, that maneuvers mobility aids to assist with fall prevention. Common objects found inside hospitals include objects with legs (i.e. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). For a mobile robot operating in such environments, safely maneuvering these objects without collision is essential. Since providing the  robot  with  dynamic models of all possible  legged objects  that  may  exist  in  such environments  is  not  feasible,  autonomous  learning  of  an approximate dynamic model for these objects would significantly improve  manipulation  planning.  We  describe  a  probabilistic method  to  do  this  by  fitting  pre categorized  object  models learned  from  minimal  force  and  motion  interactions  with  an object. In addition,   we   account   for multiple   manipulation strategies,  which  requires  a  hybrid  control  system  comprised of discrete grasps on legs and continuous applied forces. To do this,  we  use  a  simple  one-wheel  point-mass  model.  A  hybrid MPC-based manipulation planning algorithm was developed to compensate for modeling errors. While the proposed algorithm applies  to  a  broad  range  of  legged  objects,  we  only show results   for   the   case   of   a   2-wheel,   4-legged   walker   in   this paper. Simulation and experimental tests show that the obtained dynamic model is sufficiently accurate for safe and collision-free manipulation. When combined with the proposed manipulation planning algorithm, the robot can successfully move the object to  a  desired  position  without  collision.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamics Model Learning and Manipulation Planning for Objects in Hospitals Using a Patient Assistant Mobile (PAM) Robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course: CS 6350 - Machine Learning\nThis course project includes finding spammer aand bot accounts in Twitter using machine learning techniques.

The nature of human variability requires the robot to be able to learn and adapt to these changes while maintaining safety in the presence of an often unpredictable human worker. This paper proposes a novel solution to create safe and fault-tolerant motion planning and control of industrial robots for safe human-robot cooperation. First, human motion in a collaborative task with a robot was recorded with a ten-camera motion capture system. Then, a novel algorithm developed on for fault-tolerant motion planning and control of industrial robots to increase the human safety in human and robot collaboration. It has been done by characterizing human motion patterns in real-time while preventing collision between human and robot and minimizing harmful sudden motions when a failure occurs in robot actuators. The proposed algorithm benefits from using convex optimization, disjunctive programming and receding horizon concept to work in real-time. Simulation studies has been developed in ROS and Gazebo softwares and results reveals the performance of the algorithm to solve the simultaneous fault-tolerant and collision-free motion planning problem in industrial robots. Using the proposed algorithm will minimize velocity jumps of robot due to sudden actuator failures and avoid collision with human worker while maintaining acceptable levels of productivity.

This problem has been fully analyzed for two three-DOF parallel robots, ie 3s-RPR parallel mechanism and the so-called Tripteron, while the shortest path is selected as the objective function.

Since some of the constraints are non-convex, two approaches are introduced in order to convexify them: (1) A McCormick-based relaxation merged with a branch-and-prune algorithm to prevent it from becoming too loose and (2) a first-order approximation which linearizes the non-convex quadratic constraints.

Each year, about 35% of individuals over age 65 experience one or more falls. Falls are the third leading cause of chronic disability worldwide6. In this project, we tried to address the concerns with home falls with a low-cost, intelligent mobile robot that will provide mobility aids, such as a walker, in the event that it determines that risk of fall is high.\nAs the project for Motion Planning course, a simplified version of the aforementioned bigger problem was defined in a simulation-based approach. In the proposed project, the problem includes the manipulation of a walker around an obstacle-filled area using a Roomba robot from a start position to a goal position. For simulation studies, all objects will be projected to the 2D plane. The Roomba as a circle, the walker as a box, and obstacles as simple polygons. Several assumptions for the problem have been made:\n Only pushing has been used for manipulating the box. Start and goal position of the box and start position of the robot are known. Obstacles and their position are known.  The proposed approach to solve the above problem includes a high-level planner for push planning for the box and a lower level planner for motion planning of the robot. Based on what has been learned up to the point of proposal, a modified A* planning algorithm as a high-level planner in combination with RRT algorithm were proposed as the solution. The main contribution of this project is the development of a collision-free push planning algorithm for a box by a Roomba robot which includes a higher-level A* planner and a lower level RRT planner.

Generally, in parallel robots, solving the forward kinematic problem (FKP) is much harder than finding the inverse kinematic solution (IKP), thus, workspace determination using FKP is a demanding task in most cases. Therefore, in this paper, a progressive growing neural gas network algorithm (PGNGN) is proposed, which is a systematic and general approach to obtain the topology of the workspace based on IKP equations. After establishing a preliminary network with few initial data points, the network starts to develop itself by considering new data points around its border neurons through a boundary data generation procedure. The proposed algorithm is able to continue learning, adding units and connections, until a performance criterion has been met which leads to a clear workspace topology with minimal errors.

I designed a novel 4-DOF serial-parallel robot to be the base platform of driving simulators. It is a hybrid mechanism benefiting from the advantages of both serial and parallel mechanisms. The main challenge in this project was to design a mechanism structure based on the required motion for the driving simulators to provide the user with the most realistic feeling of driving. The final design is a 2-PSS+1U mechanism and the robot provides surge, pitch, roll, and heave motions. The fixed base is connected to the moving platform by two limbs with PSS as the kinematic arrangement. A fixed passive leg is connected by a U joint to the moving platform which removes four DOFs from the moving platform, resulting in a two DOF parallel mechanism. Except for the fixed limb, each leg is connected to the base and moving platform with spherical joints. The passive limb is connected to the moving platform with a universal joint.\nInverse kinematics of the mechanism is also solved to find four different working modes of the mechanism to map the required motion of moving platform into actuators. Forward kinematics of the system is also solved using elimination and resultant techniques. The design of the mechanism also includes determining singularities of the robot and its singularity-free workspace and it is done by a CAD software and interval analysis approach. Interval Analysis method has the advantages of being able to deal with almost any constraint and any number of DOF and is proved to be efficient in computing the most difficult case of 6-dimensional workspaces.

Then, the constraint imposed on the moving platform by the limbs are found which can be done by applying the concept of the reciprocal screw system to the KSS of all the limbs.

VirSense has a serial linkage mechanism and it is the 1st serial haptic device that uses a passive system for gravitational compensation. The passive system includes linear springs to compensate the forces and torques generated by the weight of the moving part of the robot without increasing the effective mass and inertia of the robot. Using the inverse dynamics, the effect of gravity on each joint has been determined and based on those values the stiffness coefficients of the designed springs are determined.\n\rCAD model of VirSense haptic device.\r\r This novel spring system allows VirSense to compensate 95% of the gravity torque passively by the springs and 5% actively by the motors. This gravity compensation is effective in the entire workspace of VirSense. In serial robots, actuators are normally placed at each active joint and move with the previous link. Therefore, fixing actuators to the base is a challenging issue. The novel cabling mechanism in VirSense allowed us to install all motors (one for the yaw axis and two for the pitch axes) on a fixed base so that the moving mass/inertia and as a result the effective mass/inertia of the robot are reduced. This approach makes using larger and more powerful motors possible which leads to higher haptic force capacity in interaction with the user.\n\rWire routes for 1st pitch (left) and 2nd pitch (right) in VirSense.\r\r In addition, kinematics, Jacobian matrix, singular points, and the workspace of VirSense are determined.

Cabling system has been designed such that the cables connected to the pitch disks will not change length with the change of the yaw angle. No interference with other cables will occur either.\nThe novel features of VirSense robot in comparison with Phantom PP1.5HF are: eliminating body motions for all three motors; allowing more powerful motors; producing larger instantaneous and continuous forces; eliminating limitations in the physical size and weight of motors; compensating 95% of gravitational torques by springs in the entire workspace of the robot; and having twice workspace as PP1.5HF robot’s workspace.\n","date":1272348000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1272348000,"objectID":"d46996784d40ef69976b9848af9f99ba","permalink":"https://amir-yazdani.github.io/project/virsense/","publishdate":"2010-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/virsense/","section":"project","summary":"Design and developing VirSense, a novel haptic device with automatic gravity compensation and fixed-base actuators","tags":null,"title":"VirSense Haptic Device","type":"project"}]
