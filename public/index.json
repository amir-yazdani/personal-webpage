We address this problem by introducing PAM, a patient assistant mobile robot, that maneuvers mobility aids to assist with fall prevention. Common objects found inside hospitals include objects with legs (i.e. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). For a mobile robot operating in such environments, safely maneuvering these objects without collision is essential. Since providing the  robot  with  dynamic models of all possible  legged objects  that  may  exist  in  such environments  is  not  feasible,  autonomous  learning  of  an approximate dynamic model for these objects would significantly improve  manipulation  planning.  We  describe  a  probabilistic method  to  do  this  by  fitting  pre categorized  object  models learned  from  minimal  force  and  motion  interactions  with  an object. In addition,   we   account   for multiple   manipulation strategies,  which  requires  a  hybrid  control  system  comprised of discrete grasps on legs and continuous applied forces. To do this,  we  use  a  simple  one-wheel  point-mass  model.  A  hybrid MPC-based manipulation planning algorithm was developed to compensate for modeling errors. While the proposed algorithm applies  to  a  broad  range  of  legged  objects,  we  only show results   for   the   case   of   a   2-wheel,   4-legged   walker   in   this paper. Simulation and experimental tests show that the obtained dynamic model is sufficiently accurate for safe and collision-free manipulation. When combined with the proposed manipulation planning algorithm, the robot can successfully move the object to  a  desired  position  without  collision.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamics Model Learning and Manipulation Planning for Objects in Hospitals Using a Patient Assistant Mobile (PAM) Robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r Amir presented in 2018 National Occupational Injury Reduction Symposiums (NOIRS 2018) with the title of “Changing Perceptions of Robotics in Industry: Recent Accomplishment in Safety and Injury Risk Reduction”.

This algorithm has several advantages, including absence of trapping in local optimums and a high computational speed. This problem has been fully analyzed for two three-DOF parallel robots, ie 3s-RPR parallel mechanism and the so-called Tripteron, while the shortest path is selected as the objective function. It should be noted that the first case study is a parallel mechanism with complex singularity loci expression from a convex optimization problem standpoint, while the second case is a parallel manipulator for which each limb has two links, an issue which increases the complexity of the optimization problem. Since some of the constraints are non-convex, two approaches are introduced in order to convexify them: (1) A McCormick-based relaxation merged with a branch-and-prune algorithm to prevent it from becoming too loose and (2) a first-order approximation which linearizes the non-convex quadratic constraints.

Markerless are more convenient since they does not requires attaching markers on human body. Both of those methods are based on using cameras and have many limitation in real applications. with the recent developments in physical human-robot interaction, estimating human posture is a demanding task specially in ergonomics and safety analysis, and adaption of robot motion based on human posture and motion.
