We address this problem by introducing PAM, a patient assistant mobile robot, that maneuvers mobility aids to assist with fall prevention. Common objects found inside hospitals include objects with legs (i.e. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). For a mobile robot operating in such environments, safely maneuvering these objects without collision is essential. Since providing the  robot  with  dynamic models of all possible  legged objects  that  may  exist  in  such environments  is  not  feasible,  autonomous  learning  of  an approximate dynamic model for these objects would significantly improve  manipulation  planning.  We  describe  a  probabilistic method  to  do  this  by  fitting  pre categorized  object  models learned  from  minimal  force  and  motion  interactions  with  an object. In addition,   we   account   for multiple   manipulation strategies,  which  requires  a  hybrid  control  system  comprised of discrete grasps on legs and continuous applied forces. To do this,  we  use  a  simple  one-wheel  point-mass  model.  A  hybrid MPC-based manipulation planning algorithm was developed to compensate for modeling errors. While the proposed algorithm applies  to  a  broad  range  of  legged  objects,  we  only show results   for   the   case   of   a   2-wheel,   4-legged   walker   in   this paper. Simulation and experimental tests show that the obtained dynamic model is sufficiently accurate for safe and collision-free manipulation. When combined with the proposed manipulation planning algorithm, the robot can successfully move the object to  a  desired  position  without  collision.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamics Model Learning and Manipulation Planning for Objects in Hospitals Using a Patient Assistant Mobile (PAM) Robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Amir presented in 2018 National Occupational Injury Reduction Symposiums (NOIRS 2018) with the title of “Changing Perceptions of Robotics in Industry: Recent Accomplishment in Safety and Injury Risk Reduction”.

In this algorithm, the network starts to grow by taking into account new data points close to its border neurons by resorting to the so-called boundary data generation procedure. By considering singularity loci expression, the separated parts are detected and each part will pursue learning, adding units and connections, until a given performance criterion will be reached. Finally, after finding cavities, if any exists, the maximal circle for each part of the workspace is found. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed providing the users with easy access to the important parameters in which the singularity-free workspace of three planar three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) parallel mechanisms are investigated in which two of them, namely, 3-RRR and 3-PRR parallel mechanisms, are among the most complicated parallel mechanisms due to their highly nonlinear and complicated singularity loci expressions.

This problem has been fully analyzed for two three-DOF parallel robots, ie 3s-RPR parallel mechanism and the so-called Tripteron, while the shortest path is selected as the objective function. It should be noted that the first case study is a parallel mechanism with complex singularity loci expression from a convex optimization problem standpoint, while the second case is a parallel manipulator for which each limb has two links, an issue which increases the complexity of the optimization problem. Since some of the constraints are non-convex, two approaches are introduced in order to convexify them: (1) A McCormick-based relaxation merged with a branch-and-prune algorithm to prevent it from becoming too loose and (2) a first-order approximation which linearizes the non-convex quadratic constraints. The computational time for the approaches presented in this paper is considerably low, which will pave the way for online applications.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal Motion Planning for Parallel Robots Via Convex Optimization and Receding Horizon.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mehdi Zamani Fekri","Mojtaba  Zareei","Mehdi Tale Masouleh","Mojtaba Yazdani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"c8af83d8daef8453a437f151627c5999","permalink":"https://amir-yazdani.github.io/publication/modares2016-quattrotaar/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/modares2016-quattrotaar/","section":"publication","summary":"Simulation of the four degree of freedom parallel robot (Quattrotaar) is subjective of this paper.

A synergy-based algorithm between convex optimization, disjunctive programming and receding horizon is proposed to the end of achieving advantages such as finding the global optimum solution and low computational time. For the purpose of the problem, different cost functions can be considered, including among others, transition time, energy usage or path length. In addition, kinematic and dynamic relations of the robots under study are expressed as constraints of the problem and since they are non-convex functions, they are approximated by convex constraints. The proposed algorithm is simulated for 3-DOF and 4-DOF redundant planar serial robots in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles using the CVX package in MATLAB and the Gurobi optimization package in the Qt Creator environment. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented on a real 4-DOF planar serial robot via the Gurobi optimization package using the C++ programming language.
