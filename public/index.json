We address this problem by introducing PAM, a patient assistant mobile robot, that maneuvers mobility aids to assist with fall prevention. Common objects found inside hospitals include objects with legs (i.e. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). For a mobile robot operating in such environments, safely maneuvering these objects without collision is essential. Since providing the  robot  with  dynamic models of all possible  legged objects  that  may  exist  in  such environments  is  not  feasible,  autonomous  learning  of  an approximate dynamic model for these objects would significantly improve  manipulation  planning.  We  describe  a  probabilistic method  to  do  this  by  fitting  pre categorized  object  models learned  from  minimal  force  and  motion  interactions  with  an object. In addition,   we   account   for multiple   manipulation strategies,  which  requires  a  hybrid  control  system  comprised of discrete grasps on legs and continuous applied forces. To do this,  we  use  a  simple  one-wheel  point-mass  model.  A  hybrid MPC-based manipulation planning algorithm was developed to compensate for modeling errors. While the proposed algorithm applies  to  a  broad  range  of  legged  objects,  we  only show results   for   the   case   of   a   2-wheel,   4-legged   walker   in   this paper. Simulation and experimental tests show that the obtained dynamic model is sufficiently accurate for safe and collision-free manipulation. When combined with the proposed manipulation planning algorithm, the robot can successfully move the object to  a  desired  position  without  collision.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamics Model Learning and Manipulation Planning for Objects in Hospitals Using a Patient Assistant Mobile (PAM) Robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r Amir presented in 2018 National Occupational Injury Reduction Symposiums (NOIRS 2018) with the title of “Changing Perceptions of Robotics in Industry: Recent Accomplishment in Safety and Injury Risk Reduction”.

Previously, there were few human interactions with robots during routine work, and most accidents with robots occurred during maintenance, setup and programming. Recently, humans and robots do more collaborative tasks, potentially increasing the risk of injury. This paper reviews and summarizes research topics mainly in robotics, but emphasizes potential research opportunities to accomplish safety and protect workers through collaborations with ergonomists and safety professionals. To protect human workers in this rapidly changing industrial paradigm shift, roboticists, ergonomists and safety professionals need to work together. Combining expertise to address human safety and optimize task planning for human-robot work will help change the perception of the safety of human-robot interactions in industry.

In this algorithm, the network starts to grow by taking into account new data points close to its border neurons by resorting to the so-called boundary data generation procedure.\nBy considering singularity loci expression, the separated parts are detected and each part will pursue learning, adding units and connections, until a given performance criterion will be reached. Finally, after finding cavities, if any exists, the maximal circle for each part of the workspace is found. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed providing the users with easy access to the important parameters in which the singularity-free workspace of three planar three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) parallel mechanisms are investigated in which two of them, namely, 3-RRR and 3-PRR parallel mechanisms, are among the most complicated parallel mechanisms due to their highly nonlinear and complicated singularity loci expressions.

The reasoning used in this paper is based on a judicious concept in detaching the whole mechanism into several subsystems and consecutive synergies between kinematic analysis, Lagrangian and Newtonian approaches. In this regard, the Tripteron is made equivalent to four subsystems and the equations of kinematic constraints are derived for all subsystems. Afterwards upon resorting to Lagrangian approach and blending it with the latter kinematic relations, the dynamic model of each leg in task space is obtained. The dynamic model of the end-effector is written in virtue of Newton-Eulers approach where yields to three differential equations. Finally, the problem leads to a system of 12 equations and 12 unknowns. For the sake of comparison, the results are put into contrast by the one obtained with a dynamic analyser software.

I designed a novel 4-DOF serial-parallel robot to be the base platform of driving simulators. It is a hybrid mechanism benefiting from the advantages of both serial and parallel mechanisms. The main challenge in this project was to design a mechanism structure based on the required motion for the driving simulators to provide the user with the most realistic feeling of driving. The final design is a 2-PSS+1U mechanism and the robot provides surge, pitch, roll, and heave motions. The fixed base is connected to the moving platform by two limbs with PSS as the kinematic arrangement. A fixed passive leg is connected by a U joint to the moving platform which removes four DOFs from the moving platform, resulting in a two DOF parallel mechanism. Except for the fixed limb, each leg is connected to the base and moving platform with spherical joints. The passive limb is connected to the moving platform with a universal joint.\nInverse kinematics of the mechanism is also solved to find four different working modes of the mechanism to map the required motion of moving platform into actuators. Forward kinematics of the system is also solved using elimination and resultant techniques. The design of the mechanism also includes determining singularities of the robot and its singularity-free workspace and it is done by a CAD software and interval analysis approach. Interval Analysis method has the advantages of being able to deal with almost any constraint and any number of DOF and is proved to be efficient in computing the most difficult case of 6-dimensional workspaces. To find the Jacobian matrix of the mechanism, first, the kinematical screw system (KSS) of all the limbs constituting the mechanism is obtained. Then, the constraint imposed on the moving platform by the limbs are found which can be done by applying the concept of the reciprocal screw system to the KSS of all the limbs. Finally, each row of the Jacobian matrix is computed by resorting again to the concept of the reciprocal screw and obtain the corresponding KSS by locking the actuators. \rCAD model of the 4-DOF serial-parallel mechanism for bus dribing simulator.\r\r\n","date":1272348000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1272348000,"objectID":"0b84f21b4343394d2620a5d17724a136","permalink":"https://amir-yazdani.github.io/project/bus_simulator/","publishdate":"2010-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/bus_simulator/","section":"project","summary":"Design a novel 4-DOF moving platform for bus driving simulators","tags":null,"title":"Bus Driving Simuator","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project included the design and implementation of VirSense, a novel 6-DoF haptic device with an emphasis on its gravity compensation and fixed-base motors. VirSense has a serial linkage mechanism and it is the 1st serial haptic device that uses a passive system for gravitational compensation. The passive system includes linear springs to compensate the forces and torques generated by the weight of the moving part of the robot without increasing the effective mass and inertia of the robot. Using the inverse dynamics, the effect of gravity on each joint has been determined and based on those values the stiffness coefficients of the designed springs are determined.\n\rCAD model of VirSense haptic device.\r\r This novel spring system allows VirSense to compensate 95% of the gravity torque passively by the springs and 5% actively by the motors. This gravity compensation is effective in the entire workspace of VirSense. In serial robots, actuators are normally placed at each active joint and move with the previous link. Therefore, fixing actuators to the base is a challenging issue. The novel cabling mechanism in VirSense allowed us to install all motors (one for the yaw axis and two for the pitch axes) on a fixed base so that the moving mass/inertia and as a result the effective mass/inertia of the robot are reduced. This approach makes using larger and more powerful motors possible which leads to higher haptic force capacity in interaction with the user.\n\rWire routes for 1st pitch (left) and 2nd pitch (right) in VirSense.\r\r In addition, kinematics, Jacobian matrix, singular points, and the workspace of VirSense are determined. A customized pulley mechanism has been designed and placed in the bottom section of the robot as a guide for power transmission cables from the motors to the links. This structure prevents the cables from rupture, entanglement, or length variation. To have permanent tension in the cables, the cable from each motor acts for both extension and flexion. Cabling system has been designed such that the cables connected to the pitch disks will not change length with the change of the yaw angle. No interference with other cables will occur either.\nThe novel features of VirSense robot in comparison with Phantom PP1.5HF are: eliminating body motions for all three motors; allowing more powerful motors; producing larger instantaneous and continuous forces; eliminating limitations in the physical size and weight of motors; compensating 95% of gravitational torques by springs in the entire workspace of the robot; and having twice workspace as PP1.5HF robot’s workspace.\n","date":1272348000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1272348000,"objectID":"d46996784d40ef69976b9848af9f99ba","permalink":"https://amir-yazdani.github.io/project/virsense/","publishdate":"2010-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/virsense/","section":"project","summary":"Design and developing VirSense, a novel haptic device with automatic gravity compensation and fixed-base actuators","tags":null,"title":"VirSense Haptic Device","type":"project"}]
